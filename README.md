## LabVenture Data Viz

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi Kim & Drew!

Welcome to my GitHub! All of the visualizations and summaries of the LabVentures stats will be shared here in this repository. You'll be able to access all the data files and math stuffs here if you'd like but there will also be summaries of all the analyses and data exploration (which I think you'll be more interested in.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Data

All the [data and code](https://github.com/carlylovas/LabVenture?tab=readme-ov-file)will live in folders named data and code (original, I know). It's here for reproducibility but also as a reference for when you want a deeper understanding of what I'm doing with the data.

#### ðŸ“– Summaries

The pretty graphs and discussions of the data will live in the summary docs linked below. They follow my train of thought, starting with the initial exploration of the data we have into some descriptive statistics. This is probably what you're interested in, more so than my incoherent code babble.
